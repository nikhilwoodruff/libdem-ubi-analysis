    "# Progressive changes to the Liberal Democrats UBI Working Group's reforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Yesterday, we released an [analysis](https://www.ubicenter.org/lib-dem-policy-paper) of universal basic income reforms described in the Liberal Democrat UBI Working Group's [discussion paper](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/1811/attachments/original/1621669347/145_-_Universal_Basic_Income.docx_%281%29.pdf?1621669347). In the working group's words, their paper \"is designed to stimulate debate and discussion within the Party and outside; based on the response generated and on the deliberations of the working group a full policy paper will be drawn up and presented to Conference for debate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this follow-up, we model a budget-neutral version of the reforms put forth in the working group paper, as well as a variety of (also budget-neutral) adjustments to those reforms. While the working group's reform would reduce poverty and inequality, we find that these adjustments, which make the UBIs more generous and inclusive, would augment their effects substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The working group's UBI reform\n",
    "\n",
    "The working group paper suggested a range of UBI amounts: 45, 60, 75, and 95 pounds per week for working-age adults. The cost was partly offset by lowering the annual Personal Allowance (for working-age adults) from £12,500 to £2,500 and the weekly National Insurance Primary Threshold from £184 to £50[^1]; these both reduce the amount of earnings one can receive before being taxed. The reform also treated the UBI as earned income for the purposes of means-tested benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result was progressive: poverty would fall by at least 17 percent, deep poverty (the population share with income below half the poverty threshold) by at least 50 percent, and inequality (the Gini index) by at least 2.8 percent. However, even the least generous of the four UBI policies added over £20 billion to the deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If made budget-neutral, this structure of pay-fors will fund a UBI of £x per week. That policy would reduce poverty by x, deep poverty by x, and inequality by x, while leaving x% of Britons better off and y% worse off. For an apples-to-apples comparison, we consider this the baseline reform against which other adjustments are evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjustments to the working group's UBI reform\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply several modifications to the working group's UBI reform that broaden the tax base (funding larger UBIs), broaden the recipient base, and change how the UBI is treated. Specifically, we model:\n",
    "- Including children in the UBI\n",
    "- Repealing the Personal Allowance and National Insurance Primary Threshold entirely\n",
    "- Including pensioners in both the Personal Allowance reduction and the UBI\n",
    "- Exempting the UBI from means-testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to modeling each of these changes individually, we consider applying all four changes together.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: A higher PA (£4,000) and PT (£50) was used for the first reform."
